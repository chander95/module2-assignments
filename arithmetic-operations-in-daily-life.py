#Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic!

bread = 3.99
peanut_butter = 6.99
jelly = 5.99

total = bread + peanut_butter + jelly
print(total)
