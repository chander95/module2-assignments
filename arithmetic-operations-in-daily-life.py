#Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic!

bread = 3.99
peanut_butter = 6.99
jelly = 5.99

total = bread + peanut_butter + jelly
print(total)

#Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

amount = 10000
interest_rate = amount * 0.07 * 1
time = 12

roi = amount + interest_rate
print(roi)
